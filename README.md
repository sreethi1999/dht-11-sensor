# dht-11-sensor
How to use the dht-11 sensor to measure the humidity and temperature. Simplified diagrams using Fritzig is employed for easy connection and understanding.
The signal pin and the VCC pin may be interchanged on account of arduino IDE (Serial Monitor) showing 0% humidity and 0C temperature(refer to the Fritzing diagram attached herewith).
However the Ground signal pin remains the same.
